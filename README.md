# new-iris Dataset Analysis Dashboard – Power BI

This project presents an interactive data analysis dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI on the classic Iris dataset, originally introduced by Ronald Fisher.

 Project Overview
The Iris dataset consists of 150 observations across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with four key features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The goal of this project was to explore patterns, compare species characteristics, and build an interactive dashboard for intuitive data visualization and analysis.

   Tools & Technologies
Power BI
Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
Data Visualization Techniques

  Key Features
Cleaned and transformed raw dataset using Power Query
Created calculated measures (Average, Min, Max, Variance) using DAX
Built interactive visuals including:
Scatter plots for species clustering
Clustered column charts for feature comparison
KPI cards for statistical summaries
Added slicers and filters for dynamic species-based analysis
Highlighted separation patterns between species based on petal measurements
